                Sir Richard Charles Nicholas Branson (born 18 July 1950) is an English business magnate and investor. He
                is best known as the founder of Virgin Group of more than 400 companies.[2]
                His first business venture was a magazine called Student at the age of 16.[3] In 1970, he set up a
                mail-order record business. In 1972, he opened a chain of record stores, Virgin Records, later known as
                Virgin Megastores. Branson's Virgin brand grew rapidly during the 1980s, as he set up Virgin Atlantic
                and expanded the Virgin Records music label.
                Branson is the 4th richest citizen of the United Kingdom, according to the Forbes 2012 list of
                billionaires, with an estimated net worth of US$4.6 billion.[1]

                Early life[edit source | editbeta]

                Branson was born in Blackheath, London, the son and eldest child of barrister Edward James Branson (10
                March 1918 – 19 March 2011)[4] and Eve Huntley Branson (née Flindt).[4][5] His grandfather, the Right
                Honourable Sir George Arthur Harwin Branson, was a judge of the High Court of Justice and a Privy
                Councillor.[6] Branson was educated at Scaitcliffe School (now Bishopsgate School)[7] until the age of
                thirteen. He then attended Stowe School until the age of sixteen. Branson has dyslexia and had poor
                academic performance as a student, but later discovered his ability to connect with others.[8]
                Career[edit source | editbeta]

                Record business[edit source | editbeta]

                Richard Branson started his record business from the crypt of a church where he ran The Student. Branson
                advertised popular records in The Student Magazine and it was an overnight success. Trading under the
                name "Virgin", he sold records for considerably less than the "High Street" outlets, especially the
                chain W. H. Smith. Branson once said, "There is no point in starting your own business unless you do it
                out of a sense of frustration." The name "Virgin" was suggested by one of Branson's early employees
                because they were all new at business.[9] At the time, many products were sold under restrictive
                marketing agreements that limited discounting, despite efforts in the 1950s and 1960s to limit so-called
                resale price maintenance.[10] In effect, Branson began the series of changes that led to large-scale
                discounting of recorded music.
                Branson eventually started a record shop in Oxford Street in London. In 1971, Branson was questioned in
                connection with the selling of records in Virgin stores that had been declared export stock. The matter
                was never brought before a court and Branson agreed to repay any unpaid tax and a fine. Branson's
                mother, Eve, re-mortgaged the family home to help pay the settlement.[9]
                Earning enough money from his record store, Branson in 1972 launched the record label Virgin Records
                with Nik Powell and bought a country estate, in which he installed a recording studio. He leased out
                studio time to fledgling artists, including multi-instrumentalist Mike Oldfield, whose debut album
                Tubular Bells (1973) was Virgin Records' first release and a chart-topping best-seller.
                Virgin signed such controversial bands as the Sex Pistols, which other companies were reluctant to sign.
                It also won praise for exposing the public to such obscure avant-garde music as Faust and Can. Virgin
                Records also introduced Culture Club to the music world. In the early 1980s, Virgin purchased the gay
                nightclub Heaven. In 1991, in a consortium with David Frost, Richard Branson had made the unsuccessful
                bid for three ITV franchisees under the CPV-TV name. The early 1980s also saw his only attempt as a
                producer—on the novelty record "Baa, Baa, Black Sheep", by Singing Sheep in association with Doug McLean
                and Grace McDonald. The recording was a series of sheep baaing along to a drum machine produced track
                and even made the charts at number 42 in 1982.
                In 1992, to keep his airline company afloat, Branson sold the Virgin label to EMI for £500 million.[11]
                Branson says that he wept when the sale was completed since the record business had been the birth of
                the Virgin Empire. He later created V2 Records to re-enter the music business.[12]
                Business ventures[edit source | editbeta]
                Main article: Timeline of Richard Branson's business ventures
                Branson formed Virgin Atlantic Airways in 1984, launched Virgin Mobile in 1999, Virgin Blue in Australia
                (now named Virgin Australia) in 2000. He was 9th in the Sunday Times Rich List 2006, worth just over £3
                billion. Branson wrote in his autobiography of the decision to start an airline:
                My interest in life comes from setting myself huge, apparently unachievable challenges and trying to
                rise above them ... from the perspective of wanting to live life to the full, I felt that I had to
                attempt it.
                In 1993, Branson took what many saw as being one of his riskier business exploits by entering into the
                railway business. Virgin Trains won the franchises for the former Intercity West Coast and Cross-Country
                sectors of British Rail.
                Virgin acquired European short-haul airline Euro Belgian Airlines in 1996 and renamed it Virgin Express.
                In 2006, the airline was merged with SN Brussels Airlines forming Brussels Airlines. It also started a
                national airline based in Nigeria, called Virgin Nigeria. Another airline, Virgin America, began flying
                out of San Francisco International Airport in August 2007. Branson has also developed a Virgin Cola
                brand and even a Virgin Vodka brand, which has not been a very successful enterprise. As a consequence
                of these lacklustre performers, the satirical British fortnightly magazine Private Eye has been critical
                of Branson and his companies (see Private Eye image caption).[13]
                A series of disputes in the early 1990s caused tension between Virgin Atlantic and British Airways,
                which viewed Virgin as an emerging competitor. Virgin subsequently accused British Airways of poaching
                its passengers, hacking into its computers and leaking stories to the press that portrayed Virgin in a
                negative light. After the so-called campaign of "dirty tricks", British Airways settled the case, giving
                £500,000 to Branson and a further £110,000 to his airline and had to pay legal fees of up to £3 million.
                Branson divided his compensation (the so-called "BA bonus") among his staff.[14]
                On 25 September 2004, Branson announced the signing of a deal under which a new space tourism company,
                Virgin Galactic, will license the technology behind Spaceship One—funded by Microsoft co-founder Paul
                Allen and designed by legendary American aeronautical engineer and visionary Burt Rutan—to take paying
                passengers into suborbital space. Virgin Galactic (wholly owned by Virgin Group) plans to make flights
                available to the public with tickets priced at US$200,000 using Scaled Composites White Knight Two.
                Branson's next venture with the Virgin group is Virgin Fuels, which is set to respond to global warming
                and exploit the recent spike in fuel costs by offering a revolutionary, cheaper fuel for automobiles
                and, in the near future, aircraft. Branson has stated that he was formerly a global warming sceptic and
                was influenced in his decision by a breakfast meeting with Al Gore.[15]
                Branson has been tagged as a "transformational leader" in the management lexicon, with his maverick
                strategies and his stress on the Virgin Group as an organisation driven on informality and information,
                one that is bottom-heavy rather than strangled by top-level management.
                On 21 September 2006, Branson pledged to invest the profits of Virgin Atlantic and Virgin Trains in
                research for environmentally friendly fuels. The investment is estimated to be worth $3 billion.[16][17]
                On 4 July 2006, Branson sold his Virgin Mobile company to UK cable TV, broadband, and telephone company
                NTL/NTL:Telewest for almost £1 billion. The new company was launched with much fanfare and publicity on
                8 February 2007, under the name Virgin Media. The decision to merge his Virgin Media Company with NTL
                was to integrate both of the companies' compatible parts of commerce. Branson used to own three-quarters
                of Virgin Mobile, whereas now he owns 15 percent of the new Virgin Media company.[18]
                In 2006, Branson formed Virgin Comics and Virgin Animation, an entertainment company focused on creating
                new stories and characters for a global audience. The company was founded with author Deepak Chopra,
                filmmaker Shekhar Kapur, and entrepreneurs Sharad Devarajan and Gotham Chopra.
                Branson also launched the Virgin Health Bank on 1 February 2007, offering parents-to-be the opportunity
                to store their baby's umbilical cord blood stem cells in private and public stem cell banks.
                In June 2006, a tip-off from Virgin Atlantic led US and UK competition authorities to investigate
                price-fixing attempts between Virgin Atlantic and British Airways. In August 2007, British Airways was
                fined £271 million over the allegations. Virgin Atlantic was given immunity for tipping off the
                authorities and received no fine—a controversial decision the Office of Fair Trading defended as being
                in the public interest.[19]
                On 9 February 2007, Branson announced the setting up of a new Global science and technology prize—The
                Virgin Earth Challenge—in the belief that history has shown that prizes of this nature encourage
                technological advancements for the good of mankind. The Virgin Earth Challenge will award $25 million to
                the individual or group who are able to demonstrate a commercially viable design which will result in
                the net removal of anthropogenic, atmospheric greenhouse gases each year for at least ten years without
                countervailing harmful effects. This removal must have long-term effects and contribute materially to
                the stability of the Earth's climate.
                Branson also announced that he would be joined in the adjudication of the Prize by a panel of five
                judges, all world authorities in their respective fields: Al Gore, Sir Crispin Tickell, Tim Flannery,
                James E. Hansen, and James Lovelock. The panel of judges will be assisted in their deliberations by The
                Climate Group and Special Advisor to The Virgin Earth Prize Judges, Steve Howard.
